# FurbyControl
A repository for revising an old project which "controls" a furby using an arduino.

The goal of this project is to make a Furby which will start making sounds and moving at a designated time. This will be done by using a relay to control when the furby powers on, and a DFPlayer Mini to make custom sounds. The built-in Furby speaker is repurposed for the DFPlayer. The furby will move when it pwoers on or hears sound. Since the DFPlayer will make sound it will move without arduino interaction.

## Things to include:
- [ ] Arduino Uno Timer Function
- [ ] 5V Relay Control
- [ ] DFPlayer Mini Control
- [ ] Battery Level Sensing
